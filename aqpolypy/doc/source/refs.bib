abstract = {The isothermal compressibility of water from 0 to 100 Â°C and 0 to 1000 bar has been determined from Wilson's sound velocity measurements which have been normalized to Kell's 1 atm values. The isothermal compressibilities determined from the sound velocities have been fit, with a maximum deviation in compressibility of Â±0.016 Ã— 10-6 bar-1, to an extended bulk modulus equation V 0P/ (V0 - Vp) = B + A1P + A2P 2, where V0 and Vp are the specific volume at an applied pressure of zero and P; and B, A1 and A2 are temperature dependent constants. Our specific volume results are in reasonable agreement with the work of Kell and Whalley at low pressures; however, our results at high pressures (1000 bar) disagree by as much as 169 ppm (the average deviation is approximately 115 ppm). A comparison of the compressibilities indicates a parabolic shift in Kell and Whalley's work with a maximum of approximately 0.205 Ã— 10-6 bar-1 at 400 bar and 5 Â°C. Since the velocity of sound data is extremely reliable ( Â±- 0.2 m/sec) and the maximum error in the compressibilities derived from the sound data is within Â± 0.016 Ã— 10-6 bar-1, our PVT results based upon the sound data are more accurate than any direct measurements made to date.},

@article{Archer1990,
abstract = {Experimental values of the dielectric constant of water suggest that, for temperatures greater than 400 K, the integral in the Kirkwood dielectric constant equation, which involves the intermolecular potential function, is a simpler function of temperature and pressure than of temperature and density. An equation has been fitted to values of this integral calculated from experimental values of the dielectric constant for temperatures from 238.15 K to 823.15 K and to pressures of approximately 500 MPa for temperatures greater than 273 K. The equation of {\^{I}}Âµ thus has explicit variables T, {\"{I}}Â, p and gives a good representation of the available experimental results. The quality of representation of the experimental results has been compared to that of previous correlations of the dielectric constant. The new equation is applicable through wider regions of independent variables than the previous equations and is capable of sufficient accuracy to provide values of Debye{\^{a}}Â€Â“H{\~{A}}Â¼ckel limiting law slopes which are as accurate as the experimental results allow. Values of Debye H{\~{A}}Â¼ckel limiting law slopes are tabulated. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. All rights reserved.},

@article{Pitzer1973a,
abstract = {A system of equations for the thermodynamic properties of electrolytes is developed on the basis of theoretical insights from improved analysis of the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel model as well as recently published numerical calculations for more realistic models. The most important result is the recognition of an ionic strength dependence of the effect of short-range forces in binary interactions. By modifying the usual second virial coefficients to include this feature, one obtains a system of equations which are only slightly more complex than those of Guggenheim but yield agreement within experimental error to concentrations of several molal instead of 0.1 M. If one compares instead with the recently proposed equations of Scatchard, Rush, and Johnson, the present equations are very much simpler for mixed electrolytes (and somewhat simpler for single electrolytes) yet appear to yield comparable agreement with experimental results for both single electrolytes and mixtures.},

@article{Levin1996,
abstract = {A physically based mean-field theory of criticality and phase separation in the restricted primitive model of an electrolyte (hard spheres of diameter a carrying charges � q) is developed on the basis of the Debye-H�ckel (DH) approach. Simple DH theory yields a critical point at T* [reverse not equivalent] kBTa/q2 = 1/16, which is only about 15{\%} above the best recent simulation estimates (Tc,sim* = 0.052-0.056) but a critical density ([varrho]c* [reverse not equivalent] [varrho]ca3 = 1/64[pi] [reverse similar, equals] 0.005 that is much too small ([varrho]c,sim* = 0.023-0.035). Allowing for hard-core exclusion effects reduces these values slightly. However, correction of the DH linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation by including pairing of + and - charges improves [varrho]c* significantly. Bjerrum's theory of the (required) association constant is revisited critically; Ebeling's reformulation is strongly endorsed but makes negligible numerical difference at criticality and below. The nature and size of the associated, dipolar ion pairs is examined quantitatively and their solvation free-energy in the residual fluid of free ions is calculated on the basis of DH theory. This contribution to the total free energy proves crucial and leads to a rather satisfactory description of the critical region. The temperature variation of the vapor pressure and of the density of neural dipolar pairs correlates fairly well with Gillan's numerical cluster analysis. Possible improvements to allow for larger ion clusters and to better represent the denser ionic liquid below criticality are discussed. Finally, the replacement of the DH approximation for the ionic free energy by the mean spherical approximation is studied. Reasonable critical densities are generated but the MSA critical temperatures are all 40-50{\%} too high; in addition, the predicted density of neutral clusters seems much too low near criticality and, along with the vapor pressure, appears to decrease too rapidly by an exponential factor below Tc.},

@article{Silvester1977,
abstract = {The ion-interaction type of equation which has proven so successful for activity and osmotic coefficients of both pure and mixed electrolytes near room temperature is extended for wide temperature ranges and for the enthalpy and heat capacity. An improved equation is obtained for the dielectric constant of water over a wide range of temperature and density; it is used to calculate the Debye-Hückel parameters to 350 °C for enthalpy and heat capacity as well as for osmotic and activity coefficients. These equations are applied to the extensive array of thermodynamic data for aqueous sodium chloride from 0 to 300 °C. Good agreement is obtained and the equations thus provide a convenient analytical representation of the thermodynamic properties of NaCl(aq). Also the results indicate that at 300 °C sodium chloride is still a strong electrolyte with little tendency toward the formation of ion pairs.},

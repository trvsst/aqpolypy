abstract = {The isothermal compressibility of water from 0 to 100 Â°C and 0 to 1000 bar has been determined from Wilson's sound velocity measurements which have been normalized to Kell's 1 atm values. The isothermal compressibilities determined from the sound velocities have been fit, with a maximum deviation in compressibility of Â±0.016 Ã— 10-6 bar-1, to an extended bulk modulus equation V 0P/ (V0 - Vp) = B + A1P + A2P 2, where V0 and Vp are the specific volume at an applied pressure of zero and P; and B, A1 and A2 are temperature dependent constants. Our specific volume results are in reasonable agreement with the work of Kell and Whalley at low pressures; however, our results at high pressures (1000 bar) disagree by as much as 169 ppm (the average deviation is approximately 115 ppm). A comparison of the compressibilities indicates a parabolic shift in Kell and Whalley's work with a maximum of approximately 0.205 Ã— 10-6 bar-1 at 400 bar and 5 Â°C. Since the velocity of sound data is extremely reliable ( Â±- 0.2 m/sec) and the maximum error in the compressibilities derived from the sound data is within Â± 0.016 Ã— 10-6 bar-1, our PVT results based upon the sound data are more accurate than any direct measurements made to date.},

@article{Rogers1982,
abstract = {Literature data for the volumetric properties of sodium chloride solutions to concentrations of 5.5 molal have been compiled and critically evaluated. A semi empirical equation of the same type found to be effective in describing the thermal properties of NaCl solutions has been used to reproduce the volumetric data from O Â°C to 300 Â°C and 1 bar to 1000 bar. Tables of values are given for the specific volume, expansivity, and compressibility. Equations also are given for calculating the pressure dependence of the free energy, enthalpy, and heat capacity. These equations can be combined with a treatment of thermal properties to form a complete equation of state for sodium chloride solutions. {\textcopyright} 1982, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

@article{Archer1990,
abstract = {Experimental values of the dielectric constant of water suggest that, for temperatures greater than 400 K, the integral in the Kirkwood dielectric constant equation, which involves the intermolecular potential function, is a simpler function of temperature and pressure than of temperature and density. An equation has been fitted to values of this integral calculated from experimental values of the dielectric constant for temperatures from 238.15 K to 823.15 K and to pressures of approximately 500 MPa for temperatures greater than 273 K. The equation of {\^{I}}Âµ thus has explicit variables T, {\"{I}}Â, p and gives a good representation of the available experimental results. The quality of representation of the experimental results has been compared to that of previous correlations of the dielectric constant. The new equation is applicable through wider regions of independent variables than the previous equations and is capable of sufficient accuracy to provide values of Debye{\^{a}}Â€Â“H{\~{A}}Â¼ckel limiting law slopes which are as accurate as the experimental results allow. Values of Debye H{\~{A}}Â¼ckel limiting law slopes are tabulated. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. All rights reserved.},

@article{Pitzer1973a,
abstract = {A system of equations for the thermodynamic properties of electrolytes is developed on the basis of theoretical insights from improved analysis of the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel model as well as recently published numerical calculations for more realistic models. The most important result is the recognition of an ionic strength dependence of the effect of short-range forces in binary interactions. By modifying the usual second virial coefficients to include this feature, one obtains a system of equations which are only slightly more complex than those of Guggenheim but yield agreement within experimental error to concentrations of several molal instead of 0.1 M. If one compares instead with the recently proposed equations of Scatchard, Rush, and Johnson, the present equations are very much simpler for mixed electrolytes (and somewhat simpler for single electrolytes) yet appear to yield comparable agreement with experimental results for both single electrolytes and mixtures.},

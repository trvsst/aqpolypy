Description: aqpolypy
        ===========
        
        aqpolypy: Povides a set of tools to analyze phase diagrams of polymers in aqueous systems, incuding electrolutes
        it most useful for tasks involving hydrogen bonding polymers and electrolytes at arbitrary concentrations. Typical usage
        often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            aqpolypy.water.WaterMilleroBP as wp
        
            wp.waterPropertiesFineMillero(300)
        
        
        Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
        and ``monospace``
